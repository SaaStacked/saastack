# SaaStack

Are you about to build a new SaaS product from scratch on .NET?

Then start with SaaStack. It’s not just a codebase template—it’s your unfair advantage.

SaaStack saves you months (or years) of engineering work by giving you a fully-featured, scalable foundation for real-world SaaS products. It solves the unavoidable: user authentication, API access, authorization schemes, third-party integrations, management API.

Yes, .NET offers the building blocks already—but you still need to know how to wire it all up in a way that scales, survives, and adapts. That takes serious architecture skills that most founding engineers or CTOs simply don’t have on day one.

Skip the startup trap:

- ❌ Reinventing the wheel, where we already have standard solutions
- ❌ Rushing forward on a fragile foundation, that is untestable, insecure, and with no production observability
- ❌ Building a tangled monolith, destined for a rewrite next year, when you discover that you cannot move fast, stuck in a big-ball-of-mud

SaaStack is opinionated, but it is also flexible and extensible and real-world, it is not a sample.

Since it is a codebase and not a nuget package (secret sauce), you never get boxed inside it waiting for some other team to improve it for you.
- ✅ It’s already battle-tested in several live SaaS companies - you benefit from their in-the-wild learnings and optimizations.
- ✅ It’s cloud-ready (Azure or AWS). It is easily extensible to work with your specific 3rd party providers, plug and play.
- ✅ It does NOT lock you into someone else's framework, and you won't have to plea with them to improve it for you, nor will you send a PR to update it for you. You own it from the start, and can modify it safely at any time.
- ✅ With extensive documentation and regression tests to guide you as you evolve or extend it, you are safeguarded against breaking anything, anywhere.
- ✅ This isn’t a NuGet package. It’s not a toy demo, it's not a code sample. It’s a fully deployable product for serious builders who want to have a robust, testable, secure and fully scalable system from day one.

To be useful now and into the future, and to guard against the future problems of scaling your business, the codebase employs and demonstrates several common architectural styles that you are going to need in your product, such as:

* [A Pluggable Modular-Monolith](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/microservices/modular-monolith-better-way-build-software) - always build a monolith first, then separate out to microservices later when, and if, you need to,and your team can support that
* [Clean Architecture, Onion Architecture, and Hexagonal Architecture](https://medium.com/@edamtoft/onion-vs-clean-vs-hexagonal-architecture-9ad94a27da91) all have the same principles - low-coupling, high-cohesion, a shareable and protected domain at its center, exposed by any protocol to any infrastructure. e.g. Hosted behind a distributed REST API, or in a CLI, (or in another executable) your choice.
* [Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) (with Aggregates and Domain Events) - modeling actual real-world behaviors, not modeling just anemic data, publishing events to a distributed system.
* [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) - because you cannot predict upfront when you will need historical data later, and when you do, you will be stuck. Domain events are already built in your aggregates, ES simply persists them as the master record, from which you can build optimized views to read data.
* [Event-Driven Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/event-driven) - to keep your modules de-coupled, distributed, and asynchronous from each other, focused on meaningful events and sagas across your whole product or products.
* [Polyglot Persistence](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PolyglotPersistence.html) - decouples you from technology choices, makes your entire system easy to test, and when your business scales up later. No need to install any databases or other server products locally, nor any docker containers, for debugging and running locally. Just clone, compile and run, all offline without a network.
* Extensive Test Automation (e.g., Unit, Integration, and E2E) layers so you can confidently keep moving years into the future
* B2B or B2C Multitenancy, you choose
* Extensibility for all integrations with any 3rd party providers (e.g., Stripe, Twilio, Auth0, LaunchDarkly, etc.) - because you want to start cheaply, and change your providers over time as your new business changes and grows, and you can afford better tools.

> The fundamental design principles behind this particular combination of architectural styles is to "maximize change" since it is change that you need to make efficient to succeed in SaaS startups, as you grow. You won't need the best at the start, that will come later. But you need to adapt, and adapt fast. It is the cost of change in software that determines the cost of designing and building software in the long run. Minimizing that cost, and keeping it low, is key for any new product tech business's survival, especially when investment is scarce.

This codebase template gives you most of the things all SaaS products will need from day one while maximizing your ability to evolve the specific behaviors and infrastructure components of your specific product - for the long run (i.e., over the course of the next 1-5 years).

## How is the code structured?

150+ projects!!

Yes, 150 projects! Why? because the world has moved on.

If you are used to cramming in all your code into one or three assemblies for your API, then you are not managing dependencies very well at all.

Even if you think you are, your favorite IDE makes it far too easy to violate decoupling rules, just by adding a `using` statement to some type, you are inadvertently adding dangerous coupling. Then, later down the track, when scaling out becomes an issue, how will you factor out that code from that tight set of assemblies into another deployable unit, when the code is all tangled up with all the rest of that code? You can't. That's why we have automated tests, and a bunch Roslyn rules to stop you accidentally creating *accidental complexity* for the sake of expediency.

Instead, what you will want at that time is a codebase structure with a very intentional separation of "modules" and separate deployable units. That are designed to be separated. These "modules" are best contained across assemblies that are explicitly separated in layers, and backed by tooling to enforce that separation, and enforce the decoupling of types - to avoid the spaghetti code that is always ahead of your team today and tomorrow.



The best experience for working with this template is in an IDE like JetBrains Rider, or Visual Studio, or Visual Studio Code (with solution file).

None of these tools nowadays (since 2022 for Visual Studio) have issues anymore with loading hundreds of projects! It is simply not a design constraint anymore. Coupling dependencies is the main issue you need to focus on managing more carefully today. A .NET project (and by extension the assembly it produces) are simply just a bounded container of code, it is not the runtime process, and nor is it deployable unit.

> If working in an IDE is not your team's thing, then you can also rearrange the project folders into whatever structure you like. SaaStack is a starter template after all! Nothing says you can't change the folder structure to what suits your context. Nothing says you can't combine the code in the projects. Go for it, have it your way! We simply recommend the structure we have given you as a starting point.

## Who is it for?

This starter template is NOT for everyone, nor for EVERY software project, nor for EVERY skill level.

> We need to say that because all software products are different, there is not one silver bullet for all of them.

* The people using this template must have some experience applying "first principles" of building new software products from scratch because it is a starter template that can (and should) be modified to suit your context. (It is a far better starting point than building everything from scratch again. You need to understand the principles, not have to rewrite them all over again!).

* The tech stack is a .NET core backend (LTS version 8.0 or later) written in C#, using (a few) but very popular and well-supported 3rd party libraries. (We've worked very hard to find a balance between too few and far too many).
* This starter template deliberately makes engineering trade-offs that are optimized for situations where:
  1. High maintainability is super important to you over long periods of time (e.g., long-lived codebases)
  2. Managing complexity over long periods of time is non-negotiable (~1-10 years), and avoiding big balls of mud (BBOMs) is paramount to you,
  3. Where many hands will touch the codebase (i.e., over the course of its entire life). Of course, if you are working alone on a project, you will have personal preferences, free from the practical constraints of working in teams.

## What is it for?

The kinds of '*known scenarios*' that this template is designed specifically for:

* Tech SaaS startups building their product from scratch
* or experienced developers who are very familiar with these patterns and concepts and wish to adapt them to their context

Can you use this template if your context is different?

* Yes, you can, but you need to be aware of why the trade-offs have been made in the way they have been made, then adapt them to your needs

Are these trade-offs suitable for any kind of software project?

* No, they are not.
  * However, some of them may fit your specific context well.

> Want to know what the initial design constraints, assumptions, and trade-offs are, then see our [Decisions Log](docs/decisions/README.md) and [Design Principles](docs/design-principles/README.md) for more details on that.

## What does it give you?

It is a starter "template," not a 3rd party library or a fancy 3rd party framework. Once you clone it, it is all yours:

* You copy this codebase, as is, as your new codebase for your product.
* You rename a few things to the name of your product.
* You compile it, you run its tests, and you deploy its pieces into your cloud environment (e.g., Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud).
* You then continue to evolve and add your own features to it (by following the established code patterns).
* You then evolve and adapt the code to wherever you need it to go.
  * Don't like those patterns? Then change them to suit your preferences. There are no rigid frameworks or other dev teams to plead with.
* At some point, you will delete the example subdomain modules (Cars and Bookings) that are provided as examples to follow and, of course, replace them with your own subdomain modules.
* Read the [documentation](docs/README.md) to figure out what it already has and how things work.
  * So that you either don't need to worry about those specific things yet (and can focus on more valuable things), or you can modify them to suit your specific needs. It is your code, so you do as you please to it.

Since this starter "template" is NOT a framework (of the type you usually depend on from others downloaded from [nuget.org](https://nuget.org)), you are free from being trapped inside other people's abstractions and regimes and then waiting on them to accommodate your specific needs.

> With this template, all you need to do: is (1) understand the code here, (2) change the code to fit your needs, (3) update the tests that cover those changes, and (4) move on. Just like you do with any and all the code you write when you join a new company, team or project. It is no different to that.

## Want it to scale?

What happens when the performance of this modular monolith requires that you MUST scale it out and break it into independently deployable pieces?

> Remember: No business can afford the expense of waiting for you to re-write your product, so forget that idea!

This codebase has been explicitly designed so that you can split it up and deploy its various modules into separate deployable units as you see fit (when your product is ready for that).

Unlike a traditional monolithic codebase (i.e., a single deployable unit), all modules in this Modular Monolith codebase have been designed (and enforced) to be de-coupled and deployed independently in the future.

You just have to decide which modules belong in which deployed components, wire things up correctly (in the DI), and you can deploy them separately.

> No more re-builds and extensive re-engineering to build a new distributed codebase when the time comes. It is all already in there for that future date.

## What does it contain?

It is a fully functioning and tested system with some common "base" functionality.

It demonstrates a working example of a *made-up* SaaS car-sharing platform just for demonstration purposes.

> You would, of course, replace that stuff with your own code! It is only there to demonstrate real code examples you can learn from.

The starter template also takes care of these specific kinds of things:

* Deployment
  * It can be deployed in Azure (e.g., App Services or Functions) or in AWS (e.g., EC2 instances or Lambdas)
  * It is designed to be split into as many deployable pieces as you want when needed. (You simply replace the "RPC adapters" with "HttpClient adapters").
* REST API
  * It defines a ruleset about how JSON is represented on the wire and how requests are deserialized (to cope with different client styles)
  * It localizes developer errors
  * It handles and maps common exceptions to standard HTTP status codes
  * It returns standard HTTP statuses for successful requests based on the HTTP method (e.g., GET = 200, POST = 201, PUT = 202, DELETE = 204)
  * Provides a Swagger UI.
* Infrastructure
  * All infrastructure components are independently testable adapters
  * It implements multi-tenancy for inbound HTTP requests (e.g., HTTP Host headers, URL keys, etc.)
  * It implements multi-tenancy (for data segregation) using either data partitioning, physical partitioning, or both.
  * It implements polyglot persistence, so you can use whatever persistence technology is appropriate for each module per data load (e.g., SQLServer, Postgres, Redis, DynamoDB, Amazon RDS, LocalFile, In-Memory, etc.)
  * It integrated 3rd party identity providers for authentication, 2FA, SSO, and credential management (e.g., Auth0, Microsoft Graph, Google, Amazon Cognito, etc.).
  * It integrates billing subscription management providers so that you can charge for your product use and determine feature sets based on subscription levels (e.g., Stripe, ChargeBee, Chargify, etc.).
  * It integrates feature flagging providers to control how to access your features and roll them out safely (e.g., LaunchDarkly, GitLab, Unleashed, etc.)
  * It integrates product usage metrics to monitor and measure the actual usage of your product (e.g., MixPanel, Google Analytics, Application Insights, Amazon XRay, etc.)
  * It integrates crash analytics and structured logging so you can plug in your own preferred monitoring (e.g., Application Insights, CloudWatch, Sentry.io, etc.).
  * It uses dependency injection extensively so that all modules and components remain testable and configurable.
  * It defines standard and unified configuration patterns (e.g., using `appsettings.json`) to load tenanted or non-tenanted runtime settings.
* Application
  * Supports one or more applications, agnostic to infrastructure interop (i.e., allows you to expose each application as a REST API (default) or as a reliable Queue, or any other kind of infrastructure)
  * Supports transaction scripts + anemic domain model or Domain Driven Design
  * Applications are aligned to audiences and subdomains
* Others
  * It provides documented code examples for the most common use cases. Simply follow and learn from the existing patterns in the codebase
  * It provides [how-to guides](docs/how-to-guides/README.md) for performing the most common things on a codebase like this until you've learned the patterns.
  * It provides a [decision log](docs/decisions/README.md) so you can see why certain design decisions were made.
  * It provides documentation about the [design principles](docs/design-principles/README.md) behind the codebase so you can learn about them and why they exist.
  * It \[will\] provide an ecosystem/marketplace of common adapters that other people can build and share with the community.
  * It demonstrates extensive and overlapping testing suites (unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests) to ensure that production support issues are minimized and regressions are caught early on. As well as allowing you to change any of the existing base code safely
  * It defines and enforces coding standards and formatting rules
  * It utilizes common patterns and abstractions around popular libraries (that are the most up-to-date in the .NET world), so you can switch them out for your preferences.
  * It defines horizontal layers and vertical slices to make changing code in any component easier and more reliable.
  * It enforces dependency direction rules so that layers and subdomains are not inadvertently coupled together (enforcing architectural constraints)
