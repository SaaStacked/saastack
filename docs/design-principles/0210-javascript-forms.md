# JavaScript Forms

## Overview

## How they work

- TBD

## How we test them
  - `data-testid` value is derived from the `id` property on the component
  - `id` property is required for all components
  - `id` property may be set as the name property on certain HTML elements (e.g., `,form/>`)
  - `id` property is used to define the `id` property of any contained components
  - `id` property is used to define the `data-testid` property of any critical contained HTML elements (that are not components).

## How they are styled

- TBD
